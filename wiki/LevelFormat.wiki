#summary How to create new levels.

= Storage Format =

Each level / map is represented as a matrix of values with each element corresponding to a different tile. The matrix is of size 100 x 100 and is stored using a column-major layout within the Android package resources as a text string. The file [http://code.google.com/p/alienbloodbath/source/browse/trunk/res/values/strings.xml res/values/strings.xml] currently contains the level definitions.

Each character value, starting with 'a' equivalent to 0, in the level string corresponds to a tile from from of the tiles sprite images (see tiles_0.png and tiles_1.png in [http://code.google.com/p/alienbloodbath/source/browse/#svn/trunk/res/drawable sprite resources]). A value of 'a' corresponds to the top most tile in the tiles image (blank open space) where as, for example 'c' corresponds to the 3rd tile from the top.

= Adding new Levels to the Game =

Currently, the available level resource IDs are hardcoded into GameState.java and, once the level definition has been added to the resource file, must also be referenced there within the {{{int[] level_ids}}} array (see [http://code.google.com/p/alienbloodbath/source/browse/trunk/src/android/com/abb/GameState.java GameState.java]).
